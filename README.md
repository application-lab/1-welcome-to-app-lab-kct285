# About Me
Hi! My name is Kimmy and I live in the Philippines before coming to Shanghai. My dad is Chinese-Filipino whilst my mom is Thai. Because of that, I've always had this great appreciation for different nationalities and cultures.  

I decided to study at NYU Shanghai because I wanted to improve my Chinese and see first-hand how China has become a very influential, global superpower just over the past few decades. I decided to major in IMB after I fell in love with Communications Lab last semester. I'm passionate about everything with graphics, interactive media, web/app designs and other beautiful things. I'm probably scrolling through Pinterest right now. 

I love love creating creatives through technology so I'm extremely excited to be in App Lab to learn more about this and further develop my current skills. 

:)
